# Experimental Code Repository

This repository contains my experimental Python code snippets. These snippets serve as a learning resource for Python programming and can be helpful for anyone who wants to learn and explore Python.

## About

In this repository, you will find various Python code files that cover different concepts, techniques, and experiments. The code snippets are small and focused, allowing you to understand specific aspects of Python programming in an isolated manner. They are meant to be simple and easy to follow, making it ideal for beginners who are learning Python.

## Contents

The repository is organized into different directories, each representing a particular topic or concept. Some of the common topics covered include:

- Control flow (if statements, loops, etc.)
- Data structures (lists, dictionaries, etc.)
- Functions and modules
- File I/O operations
- Error handling (exceptions)
- Object-oriented programming (classes, objects, inheritance, etc.)

Feel free to explore the directories and browse through the code files. Each code file is commented and includes explanations to help you understand the code's purpose and functionality.
